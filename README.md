# Homelab
[![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-TJ%20Banegas-0077B5?style=flat&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tjbanegas)

A self-hosted homelab running on Proxmox VE, built with two explicit goals: replacing commercial cloud services with privacy-respecting self-hosted alternatives, and developing hands-on infrastructure skills across Linux administration, networking, security hardening, observability, and automation.

This repository documents the infrastructure as code, configuration, and design decisions behind the lab. Every decision — including the tradeoffs and the things that broke — is documented here intentionally. The troubleshooting and reasoning are as important as the working result.

**Current trajectory:** IT/Systems Administration → Cloud Security / DevSecOps / GRC

## Core Services

### DNS: Pi-hole + Unbound

Pi-hole handles network-wide DNS filtering and ad blocking. Unbound runs as a recursive resolver, eliminating dependency on upstream DNS providers. DNS queries resolve directly from root servers rather than passing through Google (8.8.8.8), Cloudflare (1.1.1.1), or the ISP's resolver.

**Design decision:** Pi-hole and Unbound are co-located in a single LXC container. Unbound listens on `127.0.0.1:5335`; Pi-hole forwards upstream queries to it. This avoids the overhead of container-to-container networking for what is effectively a local IPC call, and reduces the attack surface compared to running Unbound on an exposed port.

**Privacy rationale:** Upstream DNS providers log queries and associate them with IP addresses. Recursive resolution means no single provider sees the full query history.

---

### Monitoring: Netdata Parent/Child Streaming

Netdata deployed in a parent/child streaming architecture:

- **Parent** (docker-host): receives and stores metrics from all nodes, serves the unified dashboard. Configured with tiered dbengine storage: full resolution for 24h, 1-minute resolution for 30 days, 1-hour resolution for ~1 year.
- **Children** (proxmox, pihole): collect and stream metrics to parent. `memory mode = none` — no local storage, metrics ship directly to parent. Reduces per-host RAM footprint by approximately 70%.

**Design decision:** Self-hosted streaming over Netdata Cloud. Netdata Cloud routes metrics through Netdata Inc's infrastructure. Keeping telemetry on-premises means no third party has visibility into infrastructure performance data or potential indicators of what services are running.

**Troubleshooting log (Netdata v2 undocumented behavior):**
These issues were found through debugging, not documentation:
- Parent requires a `[stream] enabled = no` global section in stream.conf or the streaming receiver does not initialize, even with valid API key sections present
- CIDR notation in `allow from` (e.g. `192.168.0.0/16`) silently fails in v2; wildcard `*` or specific IPs required
- Static builds on Ubuntu 25.04 install to `/opt/netdata/etc/netdata/` not `/etc/netdata/` — config path detection must be dynamic
- Each child requires a unique API key in v2; shared keys cause silent connection rejections with no useful error message
- `--install-type static` required for Ubuntu 25.04 as the native package repository does not yet carry the distro

These findings are codified in the Ansible role's dynamic config path detection and per-host key assignment.

---

### Alerting: Uptime Kuma + Signal

Uptime Kuma monitors service health across the stack:
- Proxmox web UI: HTTPS keyword check (confirms login page is served, not just that the port is open)
- Pi-hole DNS: actual DNS query resolution against the Pi-hole resolver — detects pihole-FTL crashes that a ping monitor would miss
- Docker containers: Docker socket integration for container state monitoring
- Signal CLI API: Docker container health check

Alerts delivered via Signal through a self-hosted `signal-cli-rest-api` bridge. The bridge is linked as a secondary device to an existing Signal account — no new phone number required, no third-party relay, messages are end-to-end encrypted.

**Alerting design consideration:** both the monitoring system (Kuma) and the notification path (Signal API) run on the same host. If that host goes down, alerts cannot be delivered. This circular dependency is a known limitation for homelab single-host setups. An external watchdog (e.g. Healthchecks.io with a Kuma heartbeat monitor) closes this gap and is on the roadmap.

---

### Automation: Ansible Role

An Ansible role manages Netdata installation and configuration across all hosts.

**Role capabilities:**
- Installs Netdata via official kickstart script with idempotency guard (stat check on binary path prevents re-install on existing hosts)
- Detects config directory dynamically — handles both native installs (`/etc/netdata/`) and static builds (`/opt/netdata/etc/netdata/`)
- Templates `stream.conf` and `netdata.conf` per role assignment (parent or child) using Jinja2; `inventory_hostname` resolves correctly per host
- API keys encrypted with ansible-vault; plaintext secrets never committed to git
- `--install-type static` flag handles Ubuntu 25.04 package gap
- Handler-based restarts: Netdata only restarts when config actually changes, not on every playbook run

**Secrets management:** ansible-vault encrypts the API key at rest. The vault password lives in `~/.vault_pass` on the control node only, excluded from git via `.gitignore`. The repository is safe to make public.

---

### Power Management: NUT

CyberPower 750VA Slimline UPS connected to the Proxmox host via USB. NUT monitors battery state and triggers a graceful shutdown of the hypervisor before battery exhaustion, preventing filesystem corruption from hard power loss.

Configured in standalone mode on Proxmox. UPS confirmed reachable via `lsusb` and `upsc` before software configuration. Verified `ups.status: OL` (on line).

## Security Hardening

Security is applied as defense-in-depth across the stack. The threat model is a home network — no internet-facing services — but hardening is applied as if the network boundary could be crossed, because it sometimes can be (compromised LAN device, vulnerable IoT device, etc.).

### Network Perimeter

- **No ports forwarded from the internet.** All remote access exclusively through Tailscale. The attack surface visible from the internet is zero.
- **Tailscale ACLs** segment the tailnet by device role:
  - `tag:admin` (laptops, control node): full access to all infrastructure
  - `tag:server` (VMs): unrestricted inter-server communication for Netdata streaming, Ansible SSH, DNS
  - `tag:personal` (phone): web UI access only (ports 80, 443, 3001, 9443, 19999, 8006) — no SSH
  - Entertainment devices (Apple TV): no access to infrastructure

### Host Hardening (all managed hosts)

- Root SSH login disabled (`PermitRootLogin no`)
- Password authentication disabled (`PasswordAuthentication no`) — SSH key authentication only
- Non-root admin users with scoped sudo
- UFW firewall active on all Ubuntu hosts:
  - Default policy: deny incoming, allow outgoing
  - Allowed inbound: LAN subnet (`192.168.1.0/24`), Tailscale subnet (`100.64.0.0/10`)
- Unattended-upgrades configured for automatic security patching on all Ubuntu hosts

### Docker-Specific

- Docker's iptables management disabled (`{"iptables": false}` in `daemon.json`) to prevent Docker from bypassing UFW rules — a well-known default behavior that silently exposes container ports regardless of firewall state
- Signal CLI API container not exposed externally; accessed only from Kuma on the same host via LAN IP

### Proxmox

- TOTP two-factor authentication on web UI admin account
- NUT provides hardware-level protection against ungraceful shutdown

### Secrets

- Ansible-vault encrypts sensitive values at rest in the repository
- SSH private keys never leave their originating host
- All services use unique passwords; no shared credentials across services

## What I Would Do Differently

- **Netdata before Ansible, not instead of.** Setting up streaming manually first, then codifying it in Ansible, meant debugging both the service and the automation simultaneously. Manual setup → verify → automate is a cleaner sequence.
- **Separate API keys from the start.** Used a shared Netdata streaming API key across children initially. Netdata v2 silently rejects duplicate key connections. Per-child unique keys should be the default, not a fix.
- **UFW before Docker.** Enabling UFW on a Docker host without first disabling Docker's iptables management creates a false sense of security — Docker bypasses UFW silently. The correct order is: configure daemon.json → restart Docker → enable UFW.
- **Cloud-init for VM provisioning.** Initial VM setup used the interactive Ubuntu installer, which had persistent keyboard input issues in Proxmox's noVNC console. Cloud images with cloud-init are faster, more reproducible, and avoid the console entirely.
